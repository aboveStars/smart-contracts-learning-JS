# **Solidity Basics - Remix**

### **In this section, we have learned `basics` of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/) with [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) like :**

- `Writing a smart contract`
- `Deploying a smart contract`
- `Interact with deployed smart contract`

#### **This section has two parts :**

- **[Simple Storage](https://github.com/aboveStars/smart-contracts-learning-JS/tree/main/SolidityBasics-RemixIDE/Storage) :**
  - Just `storing` values. (We can `change` the value of course then)
- **[Fund Me](https://github.com/aboveStars/smart-contracts-learning-JS/tree/main/SolidityBasics-RemixIDE/Fund) :**
  - A `smart contract` for people who want to `fund` us.
  - Smart contract just accepts `values above a dedicated value in dollars.`
    - `To convert` (ETH <=>Â $), we have used [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/).
  - You can see more than one contract in `Fund Me` because of `"gas-optimizations"` we made. I don't want to omit the `"gas-monster"` contracts.
